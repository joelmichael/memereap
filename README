MemeReap is a Twitter clone written in C.

This application is designed as a sample application from which a C web framework
will be abstracted.

This is very early software.  It is is built on a Mac, using mysql and fcgi installed via MacPorts.
Without Makefile modification, it will only compile in this environment.
